# London Underground Route Planner (Tkinter)

A simple, offline GUI app built with Python and tkinter to plan routes on the London Underground. It ships with a curated subset of the network for demo purposes and can be extended easily. Future versions can plug into the live TfL APIs for real‑time status and journey times.

## Features

- Pick start and end stations from searchable dropdowns
- Route planning using a shortest‑stops (BFS) algorithm
- Leg breakdown with line names and interchange points
- Estimated journey time (rough heuristic)
- Clean, readable UI with TfL‑inspired styling

## Screenshots

Coming soon.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- tkinter (included with most Python distributions on Windows/macOS)

### Run locally

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
   - Windows (PowerShell): `py -3 -m venv .venv; .venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`
   - Bash (Git Bash): `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/Scripts/activate`
2. Start the app: `python main.py`

If the UI doesn't appear, ensure tkinter is available in your Python install.

## Project structure

- `main.py` — tkinter GUI application (widgets, layout, interactions)
- `tube_network.py` — London Underground graph, route finding and details
- `README.md` — This file

## How it works

- The network is represented as a graph: `graph[station] = [(neighbor, line, minutes)]`
- A Breadth‑First Search (BFS) finds the shortest number of stops between two stations
- Human‑readable legs are generated by detecting line changes along the path

### Notes

- The included data is a partial but useful subset of the network. You can extend it by adding more stations and connections in `tube_network.py`.
- Interchange walks (e.g., Bank–Monument, Euston–Euston Square) are modeled as short "Walk" edges.

## Roadmap / Future enhancements

- Integrate TfL Unified API for:
  - Live service status, delays, and closures
  - Real journey times and routing preferences (fewest changes, fastest, step‑free, etc.)
- Full network coverage and import from open datasets
- Visual map overlay and colorized route leg rendering in the UI
- Export/share journey itineraries

## Extending the network

In `tube_network.py`, add connections like:

```python
self._add_connection('Station A', 'Station B', 'Line Name', time=2)
```

- Keep time as an integer in minutes (heuristic; real‑time via API later)
- Add both directions by calling `_add_connection` once (it adds A↔B)
